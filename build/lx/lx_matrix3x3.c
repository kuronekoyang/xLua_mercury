     *     Arbitrary axis rotation matrix.
     *
     *  This is composed of 5 matrices, Rz, Ry, T, Ry', Rz', multiplied
     *  like so:  Rz * Ry * T * Ry' * Rz'.  T is the final rotation
     *  (which is about the X-axis), and the two composite transforms
     *  Ry' * Rz' and Rz * Ry are (respectively) the rotations necessary
     *  from the arbitrary axis to the X-axis then back.  They are
     *  all elementary rotations.
     *
     *  Rz' is a rotation about the Z-axis, to bring the axis vector
     *  into the x-z plane.  Then Ry' is applied, rotating about the
     *  Y-axis to bring the axis vector parallel with the X-axis.  The
     *  rotation about the X-axis is then performed.  Ry and Rz are
     *  simply the respective inverse transforms to bring the arbitrary
     *  axis back to its original orientation.  The first transforms
     *  Rz' and Ry' are considered inverses, since the data from the
     *  arbitrary axis gives you info on how to get to it, not how
     *  to get away from it, and an inverse must be applied.
     *
     *  The basic calculation used is to recognize that the arbitrary
     *  axis vector (x, y, z), since it is of unit length, actually
     *  represents the sines and cosines of the angles to rotate the
     *  X-axis to the same orientation, with theta being the angle about
     *  Z and phi the angle about Y (in the order described above)
     *  as follows:
     *
     *  cos ( theta ) = x / sqrt ( 1 - z^2 )
     *  sin ( theta ) = y / sqrt ( 1 - z^2 )
     *
     *  cos ( phi ) = sqrt ( 1 - z^2 )
     *  sin ( phi ) = z
     *
     *  Note that cos ( phi ) can further be inserted to the above
     *  formulas:
     *
     *  cos ( theta ) = x / cos ( phi )
     *  sin ( theta ) = y / cos ( phi )
     *
     *  ...etc.  Because of those relations and the standard trigonometric
     *  relations, it is pssible to reduce the transforms down to what
     *  is used below.  It may be that any primary axis chosen will give the
     *  same results (modulo a sign convention) using thie method.
     *
     *  Particularly nice is to notice that all divisions that might
     *  have caused trouble when parallel to certain planes or
     *  axis go away with care paid to reducing the expressions.
     *  After checking, it does perform correctly under all cases, since
     *  in all the cases of division where the denominator would have
     *  been zero, the numerator would have been zero as well, giving
     *  the expected result.
